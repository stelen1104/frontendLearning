# frontendLearning
A collection of my work as I learn front-end development. Each folder covers a technology or tool, from HTML/CSS basics to React, Redux, TypeScript, and REST APIs. It includes code samples, mini-projects, and exercises to demonstrate my understanding and practical application of these skills.
